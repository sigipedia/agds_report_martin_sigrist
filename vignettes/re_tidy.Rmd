# Manual data cleaning

The following manual modifications have been done with Excel:

-   Removed header text
-   Modified column headers
  o   time in years
  o   CO~2~ content in g~C~ m^-2^
-   Removed empty rows
-   Filled up empty cells in experiment column

The cleaned data was saved in a csv-file for usage in this work.

# Load Packages

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Import Data
```{r}
elev_CO2_exp <- readr::read_delim("../data/1249534s1-s6_cleaned.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE) # Read data set from file
```

# Log-response ration per experiment

Data are aggregated per experiment by calculating the mean value for the ambient (low) and elevated (high) CO~2~ concentration. As the development over time is not from interest, the data evaluation can be done like that.

```{r}
experiment_data <- elev_CO2_exp |>                                          # Elevated CO2 Experiments data set
  select(experiment, ends_with("CO2_mean")) |>                              # Take columns from interest
  group_by(experiment) |>                                                   # Group data by experiment
  summarise(amb_CO2 = mean(amb_CO2_mean), inc_CO2 = mean(inc_CO2_mean)) |>  # Calculate mean values per experiment
  mutate(LRR = log(inc_CO2 / amb_CO2))                                      # Calculate Log-Response Ration

# Log-response ration per time phase

The log-response ration per phase in the experiment is calculated first for each data point. The number of data point for the three stages (early, mid and late) are different. The mean values of the log-response ratio for each phase is calculated at the end to avoid over weighting of the data points in the phases with a low number of measurements. The temporal development during the experiments are not from interest.
